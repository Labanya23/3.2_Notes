    "Here the trigPin is 1st set to LOW cause to avoid any other noise then its HIGH. When high waves emit through it. Then it low. Now echoPin will receive the reflected waves. pulsIn is a library widely used for sonar sensor. Duration is divided by 2. Cause here duration is the time the wave goes and reflected back so the duration distance is doubled when the wave is received. Thus dividing the duration gives us only the duration from the sensor to the point of reflection and with it we can get distance. Here we multiply the duration with `0.0343` the reason is explained below. If an obstacle is with in 10cm then LED high otherwise low.\n",
