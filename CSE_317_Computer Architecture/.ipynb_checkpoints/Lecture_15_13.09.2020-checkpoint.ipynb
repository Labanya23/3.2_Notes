    "In I-type instruction we have seen two types of instruction. load from and save to (read & write) from memory. Previously we saw 5 elements but for this instruction we'll need a 6th element, that is data memory. Data memory and instruction memory are different things MIPS architecture. We read and write data from data memory. And instruction memory holds instruction against instruction address. Memread is for reading from memory and MemWrite is for writing to memory. immed is the offset value. To get the physical offset is added to the base address.\n",

If we do read from memory then we need to store the data that was read from memory in a register. So the output is SW. And if we do write operation then the data to write to the address will come to the write data input point. So its SW.\n",

In read register 1 we pass the number of register, so s1 value is passed through read data 1 to ALU and immed turns the 16bit offset to 32 bit offset and also passes this to ALU. Both 32bit data are added to get the physical address. Then the physical address is passed to data memory to fetch data from that address. Data comes to write data point and it is saved in register t0 for this example. So write register gets the number of t0 register. In data memory MemRead is set to indicate read operation.\n",

Now base address is passed from read data 1 to ALU and immedis also passed to ALU to get the physical address.  Then address and read data 2 ( the value to be stored) is passed to the data memory.
