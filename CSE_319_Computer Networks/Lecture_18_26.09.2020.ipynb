Issues of symmetric is it requires sender and receiver to share the same key thus how to agree on the same key when the both parties never met before. And another issue is if there is n users each user have to keep state of n-1 key pair. Like here are 6 users in the example now one user has a shared key with all other. So he has 5 shared key like these the other 5 user will have to keep state of 5 shared keys.\n",
