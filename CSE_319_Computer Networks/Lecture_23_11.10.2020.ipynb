    "Double spending problem is like we spend same currency two time. Like you made a copy of 1 dollar bill. Now you have an original bill and a fake one. So in total you have 2 dollars and if you can spent both you'll be able to purchase a good that's worth 2 dollar but actually you'll pay 1 dollar. We spent double of the original bill. Double spending can't happen in real life cause its easy to catch fake bills. But for online transaction that doesn't include financial institution like banks,e-pay systems we can't detect the fake bill. So how to solve this double spending problem?A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (crypto currency, i.e. Bitcoin) is a financial institution less online transaction system which implements a solution for this problem. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.\n",
