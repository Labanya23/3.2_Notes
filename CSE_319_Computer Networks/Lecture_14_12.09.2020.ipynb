    "VC(virtual circuit) will get forwarding table from routing table. Routing table will show the whole connection path. And according to VC number we'll determine the forwarding of packet. Forwarding is selecting the port from which the packet will enter and exit the router. Let assume a packet comes to router 1 using port 1. Now it's VC is 2, so we look up to the forwarding table and find which port the router should use to forward the packet. We find a port against that VC number 2 so router use that port to forward the packet.\n",
